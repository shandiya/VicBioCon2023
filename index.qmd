[I acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands on which I live and work, the Wurundjeri People of the Kulin Nation, and pay my respects to Elders past and present.

::: notes
The Atlas of Living Australia was launched in 2010 and is now the most comprehensive dataset on Australian biodiversity, with over 100 million records sourced from more than 800 data providers, which includes collections like iNaturalist, BirdLife, and the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas. So it aggregates data from natural history collections, government departments, researchers, community groups, and individuals, and makes it all available online for anyone to access.
